     Cassy Hayes and Jasmine Coleman were among the first fans to arrive outside
     the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles where Michael Jackson
     was brought and later pronounced dead. How had Hayes, 25, and Coleman, 21,
     heard the news so quickly?<br><br></p>

   <p class="article" id="art-small"><b>Twitter.</b><br><br></p>

   <p class="article" id="art-small"> The two young women had learned about Jackson's health like so many who
     get their news nowadays: by reading the ever-flowing feed of real-time
     information on the microblogging service.<br><br>

     Jackson's unexpected death at 50 was just one of the many news event
      where Twitter played a central role. But just as quickly as Twitter
      has emerged as a news source, so, too, has its susceptibility to false
      rumors and false news become abundantly apparent.<br><br></p>

    <p class=“article” id="art-small">Twitter’s constantly updating record of
      up-to-the-minute reaction has in some instances threatened to usurp media
      coverage of breaking news. It has also helped many celebrities, athletes
      and politicians bypass the media to get their message directly to their
      audience. These days it is no surprise to see politicians in the US
      converse with each other through the medium. And as our eyes are turned to
      Twitter, so has our way of collecting information about the world.
      There is something about the short, quick messages (of a maximum of 280
      characters) that fits within our way of life at the moment: it has to be
      short, but especially quick.<br><br></p>

    <p class="article">In January, Twitter emailed nearly 700,000 users to tell
      them they may have engaged with the Russian accounts. Less than two weeks
      later, Twitter announced the number of users notified had more than doubled.
      These were Twitter users set-up from Russia and engaging in inflammatory
      tweets, with the goal of disrupting and dividing a nation’s public,
      and thus their political policies.<br><br>

      Thankfully, at the request of NBC News, three sources familiar with
      Twitter's data systems cross-referenced the list of names released by
      Congress, excluding any account that Twitter later restored, to create
      a partial database of tweets that could be recovered from the suspended
      accounts.<br><br>

      I took a deeper look in to this database, to see if I saw something
      unusual. There exists this idea that Russian trolls on Twitter engaged
      in the spread of fake news and support,
      with the aim of influencing an election, in particular the 2016 United
      States Presidential Elections, which was won by Donald Trump in November.
      How much of this is actually true?<br><br>

      I started looking for some evidence to support this claim, and looked at
      how many tweets were actually sent out by these trolls. I displayed the
      data in the (interactive) chart at the bottom of this page. Do you also
      notice something… <i>particular?
      <br><br><hint>Hint: the elections were in September-October-November</hint></i><br><br>

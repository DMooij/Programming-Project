     <ht>Communities<br></ht>

     As you've might have seen in the word cloud on the <a href="second.html">
     previous page</a>, not only tags were used in support of the American
     right-wing (Republicans), the 'left' (Democrats) were supported by these tweets as well. The database I used,
     discovered that there were actual seperate communities within these
     Russian trolls. What does it mean to be a <i>community</i>?<br><br></p>

   <p class="article" id="art-small">Well, these trolls didn't only tweet about
     certain topics, they interacted with each other as well. They did this through
     <i>retweeting</i>: if you retweet something, you copy another user's comment
     on the Twitter website for your own followers to read. Through retweeting,
     the trolls were reinforcing each others messages and strengthening the message
     they tried to disperse. By analyzing which users tweeted each other, I was able
     group certain trolls into communities!<br><br>



    <p class=“article” id="art-small">Through this, we were able to determine
      that most of the original tweets written in the Russian troll network were
      written by a small number of users, such as <tag>@TEN_GOP</tag>. As mentioned above,
      the majority of overall tweets were retweets, because many of the Russian
      troll accounts were solely retweeting other accounts in an attempt to amplify the message.<br><br></p>

    <p class="article" id="art-small">I wanted to look at how these tweets by these users were.
      Did they tweet positive things, or were they really negative? For the Republican
      side, I looked at the hashtag <button class="rep-tag" id="TRUMP">#TRUMP</button>. To dive a little
      bit deeper, I also looked at the hashtag <button class="rep-tag" id="MAGA">#MAGA</button>. Use
      the chart to the right to see the results!<br><br>

      <p class"article" id="hint" width="100%">
        <hint><i>The hashtag <tg class="rep-tag" id="MAGA">#MAGA</tg> stands for MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
          Used for the Donald's 2016 presidential campaign.<br></i></hint>
      </p>

      <p class="article">Looking at the trolls showing support for the Democrats,
        I looked at the hashtag <button class="dem-tag" id="CLINTON">#CLINTON</button>.
        I noticed that the 'left-wing' communities engaged a lot in conversations
        concerning the rise in police violence against African Americans. To view
        many negative and positive words these trolls used, I also did a
        sentiment analysis on the hashtag <button class="dem-tag" id="BLACKLIVESMATTER">
          #BLACKLIVESMATTER</button>. Do you see any differences?

      <p class"article" id="hint">
        <hint><i>The hashtag <tg class="dem-tag" id="BLACKLIVESMATTER">
          #BLACKLIVESMATTER</tg> stands for a movement African Americans used
          to show that they matter too. It doesn't mean that they don't care about other
          races lifes, It just means their life should matter too.<br></i></hint>
      </p>

  <p class="article">So, what can social media platforms and governments do to
    monitor and prevent future abuse?

    First, it’s a matter of connections. In today’s hyper-connected world,
    it’s difficult to identify relationships in a dataset if you’re not using a
    technology purpose-built for storing connected data. It’s even more difficult
    if you’re not looking for connections in the first place.<br><br>

    Second, once something as this is realised, it is important for governments
    and tech-companies to take action to solve these issues. A democracy is led by
    the will of the people, but what if the will of the people isn't based on their
    own ration thoughts -- but rather on thoughts injected in their heads by external sources,
    e.g. through the media? What's left of a democracy at that point?<br><br>

    And last but not least: be critical. Think about what you read and don't take
    anything for granted you see online, because in this higly mediatized society
    we live in nowadays, not everything is really real, and every person can be fake.<br><br>

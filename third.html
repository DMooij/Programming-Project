     <ht>Communities<br></ht>

     As you've might have seen in the word cloud on the <a href="second.html">
       previous page</a>, not only tags were used in support of the American
       right-wing (Republicans), the 'left' (Democrats) were supported by these tweets as well. The database I used,
       discovered that there were actual seperate communities within these
       Russian trolls. What does it mean to be a <i>community</i>?<br><br></p>

   <p class="article" id="art-small">Well, these trolls didn't only tweet about
     certain topics, they interacted with each other as well. They did this through
     <i>retweeting</i>: if you retweet something, you copy another user's comment
     on the Twitter website for your own followers to read. Through retweeting,
     the trolls were reinforcing each others messages and strengthening the message
     they tried to disperse. By analyzing which users tweeted each other, I was able
     group certain trolls into communities!<br><br>



    <p class=“article” id="art-small">Through this, we were able to determine
      that most of the original tweets written in the Russian troll network were
      written by a small number of users, such as <tag>@TEN_GOP</tag>. As mentioned above,
      the majority of overall tweets were retweets, because many of the Russian
      troll accounts were solely retweeting other accounts in an attempt to amplify the message.<br><br></p>

    <p class="article" id="art-small">I wanted to look at how these tweets by these users were.
      Did they tweet positive things, or were they really negative? For the Republican
      side, I looked at the hashtag <button class="rep-tag" id="TRUMP">#TRUMP</button>. To dive a little
      bit deeper, I also looked at the hashtag <button class="rep-tag" id="MAGA">#MAGA</button>. Use
      the chart to the right to see the results!<br><br>

      <p class"article" id="art-small">
        <hint><i>The hashtag <tg class="rep-tag" id="MAGA">#MAGA</tg> stands for MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
          Used for the Donald's 2016 presidential campaign.<br><br></i></hint>
      </p>

      <p class="article">Looking at the trolls showing support for the Democrats,
        I looked at the hashtag <button class="dem-tag" id="CLINTON">#CLINTON</button>.
        I noticed that the 'left-wing' communities engaged a lot in conversations
        concerning the rise in police violence against African Americans. To view
        many negative and positive words these trolls used, I also did a
        sentiment analysis on the hashtag <button class="dem-tag" id="BLACKLIVESMATTER">
          #BLACKLIVESMATTER</button>. Do you see any differences?

      <p class"article" id="art-small">
        <hint><i>The hashtag <tg class="dem-tag" id="BLACKLIVESMATTER">
          #BLACKLIVESMATTER</tg> stands for a movement African Americans used
          to show that they matter too. It doesn't mean that they don't care about other
          races lifes, It just means their life should matter too.<br><br></i></hint>
      </p>


      <!-- Before I started exploring the data base, I had this idea
      that Russian trolls had the aim of making Donald Trump president, so I
      expected all tags to support the Trump campaign, and to disapprove the
      campaign of his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton. Yet they didn't.
      Yeah, you see a lot of <tag>#Trump</tag> and <tag>#MakeAmericaGreatAgain</tag>,
      but that's not all. There are also a lot of tweets containing tags
      <i>supporting</i> <tag>#Clinton</tag> and the <tag>#BlackLivesMatter</tag>
      campaign. Why? Why would you support both sides of the spectrum? I was clueless.<br><br>

      And then it hit me. I saw a fascinating
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgmg2VFX058"><tag>#video</tag></a>
      on YouTube, about an interview with an ex-KGB agent discussing Russian
      propaganda tactics. In short, he talks about how they (during the Soviet-era)
      tried to disrupt other nations by splitting them up in seperate groups and
      pushing both groups to their respective (ideological) extremes. "Divide and
      conquer", as some would say. They were creating seperate <tag>#communities</tag>,
      and pit them against each other. Interesting. <br><br>

      Take a look for yourself. See how these trolls tweeted over 2016, and take
      a specific look at how they tweeted in the months leading up to the Presidential
      elections. What do you notice?<br><br> -->

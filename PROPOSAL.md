# Programming Project

Final project for the Minor Programming at the University of Amsterdam

## Context

Communication science teaches us how (modern) media have an influence on our attitudes, behaviours and knowledge. These influences are important to examine, because this influence may reach the way we think and know about a topic, and how we subsequently choose to deal with these issues.

Recent news outlets have been bombarded by the topic of 'fake news', a form of information dissemination that contains unverified - thus usually false - information, with an attempt to mislead the public. Fake news isn't reserved for just traditional forms of media, such as news articles, but is also prevalent on social media, such as Facebook, Reddit or Twitter.

As part of the House Intelligence Committee investigation into how Russia may have influenced the 2016 US Election, Twitter released the screen names of almost 3000 Twitter accounts believed to be connected to Russiaâ€™s Internet Research Agency, a company known for operating social media troll accounts. Twitter immediately suspended these accounts, deleting their data from Twitter.com and the Twitter API. A team at NBC News including Ben Popken and EJ Fox was able to reconstruct a dataset consisting of a subset of the deleted data for their investigation and were able to show how these troll accounts went on attack during key election moments. This dataset is the body of this open-sourced reconstruction.

For more background, read the NBC news article publicizing the release: "Twitter deleted 200,000 Russian troll tweets. Read them here: https://goo.gl/Vhmzwt

## Problem statement

There is a widespread lack of knowledge or understanding about how Russian trolls might have influenced the outcome of the 2016 American presidential elections, and an interactive visualization is particularly suited to remedy this problem. By examining the tweets sent out by these trolls, we can find out what these tweets were about, and how it logically might explain their influence.

## Solution

By visualising when these troll accounts were created, what they tweeted about, and when they tweeted, we might be able to link their online activity to certain events, such as the presidential elections.

A sketch of how this may be implemented:

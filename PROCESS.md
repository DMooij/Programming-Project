Today I finished my project! Very happy about it.

## 27-06-2016

It's getting there. Still need some finishing touches, and need to finish the article.

## 26-06-2016

I stopped trying to display my visualisations on one page, I am now doing it multi-page.

## 25-06-2016

Still trying to get my visualisations working... but they won't... version 3 and 4 can't work together.

## 22-06-2016

My visualisations won't stay together on the page.

## 21-06-2016

Made a donut chart, with sentiment analysis.

## 20-06-2016

Finished word cloud!

## 19-06-2016

Word cloud is getting there, still very buggy.

## 16-06-2016

I want to do a word cloud, but it's annoying how hard it is to do...

## 15-06-2016

Looking for a word cloud. Might be fun, but the hard implementation (with algorithm) seems very tricky.

## 13-06-2016

Got a great tip, and made a very cool brush and zoom line chart!

## 12-06-2016

Meh, line chart might not be great. Bar chart neither.

## 11-06-2016

Got some very cool data. I'm excited.

## 09-06-2016

Found a very nice data base with all the data I need.

## 08-06-2016

I found a subject. I am going to do it on Russian trolls.
